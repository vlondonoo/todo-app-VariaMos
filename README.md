# Welcome to todo-app

**todo-app**: is a [Software Product Line (SPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_product_line) project. This project allows to derivate different to-do web applications, depending on a custom configuration.

The to-do applications can have the following features:
  * Create and delete tasks.
  * Sort tasks by name.
  * Create tasks with images.
  * Check and uncheck completed tasks.

Here the two different tools used to derivate the todo-app products.

## VariaMos and FragOp

 * [VariaMos (an SPL tool)](https://github.com/VariaMosORG/VariaMos/wiki) is a modeling tool that can be easily extended, and that allows you to define your models.

* [FragOp approach](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328766451_Fragment-oriented_programming_A_framework_to_design_and_implement_software_product_line_domain_components) (an approach to implement SPLs)  is a framework to design and implement software product line domain components. 

FragOp framework together with the VariaMos tool help to generate or derivate a product with the desired features.
